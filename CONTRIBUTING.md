# Contributing

Thanks for taking an interest. This repository documents real, shipped work by Tarek Okasha, so contributions are welcome where they make it more accurate, more accessible or easier to use.

## Good contributions

- Accessibility fixes, especially for Arabic (right-to-left) layouts and screen readers.
- Bugs in the theme code, with the steps to reproduce them.
- Performance improvements that keep the rule of zero third-party requests from theme code.
- Corrections and clarifications to the documentation.

## Not accepted

- Brand assets (logos, fonts, photography) or any client data.
- Changes that add third-party network requests, tracking or analytics.
- Reformatting-only pull requests.

## Before you open a pull request

1. Open an issue first for anything larger than a small fix, so effort is not wasted.
2. Run the checks and make sure they pass:

- `node scripts/check-repo.mjs`
- `node scripts/gate-rtl.mjs`
- `php scripts/check-content-keys.php`
- `find qx-theme -name '*.php' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 php -l`

3. Keep the change focused, and describe what you changed and why.
